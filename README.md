#### Deployed link :  https://eco-wear.netlify.app/
EcoWear is a full-stack e-commerce platform for buying and selling second-hand clothes. It allows users to create posts, upload images of clothing items, and browse, purchase, or comment on listings. The project is built using the MERN stack with a focus on efficiency, security, and scalability.

## Features
#### User Authentication & Authorization: 

Users can sign up, log in, and securely manage their accounts using JWT tokens for authentication, which are stored as HTTP cookies.

Middleware ensures secure API access.

#### Image Management:

Users can upload up to 5 images per post with real-time validation, previews, and deletion options.

GridFS is used to efficiently store and retrieve images from MongoDB.

#### Product Listings & CRUD Operations:

Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations for products, with real-time data updates on the client side.

Each post includes details like clothing type, size, price, description, and uploaded images.

#### User-specific Homepages:

After logging in, users are greeted with personalized content and have the ability to edit their profiles.

#### Responsive Design:

Built with Chakra UI to ensure a seamless experience across all devices, including mobile, tablet, and desktop.
